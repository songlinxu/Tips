# What if your video could not be exported to 1080p (only 720p)?

Here are the steps:

1. Open a new project and insert a sample video whose size is 1080p.
2. Check if you could export 1080p video from this new project (Usually you could. If not, try a new 1080p sample video).
3. Go back to your old project and use cmd+A with cmd+C to copy all your sub-videos in your old project.
4. Go to your new project and use cmd+V to paste your sub-videos after the new 1080p sample video.
5. Check if you could still export 1080p video (Usually you could).
6. Delete the new 1080p sample video and check if you could still export 1080p video. If so, you're all set!



# Useful subtitle templates in iMovie:

- Ticker
- Gradient Black
- Reveal Lower Third

Note: except for Ticker, you could not set the font size of other templates. This may result in different font size in different sentences of your video.
